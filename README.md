# EightFiftyThree GRC

Browser-based NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 program management tool. Sign in with your work account; program data syncs through Supabase.

If the link shows “404 / There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here,” open the repo on GitHub → **Settings → Pages** → set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**, then push to `main` (or run the **Deploy GitHub Pages** workflow manually).

## Repository Status

This repository is the canonical source for the public **EightFiftyThree GRC** release.

- Intended for public GitHub upload and GitHub Pages deployment
- Root documentation is intentionally scoped to operator and contributor essentials
- Long-form internal planning prompts are kept out of root docs for cleaner public presentation

## What It Covers

The application guides teams through a full governance workflow:

- CISO setup wizard (baseline, privacy overlay, PM controls, ISP, policy ownership)
- Domain policy ownership and lifecycle tracking
- Control owner assignment and control implementation status
- Asset and process mapping for SSP-style attestations
- Authorizing-Official decision capture (ATO / IATT / Denial) with conditions, expiry, residual-risk narrative, and digital signature
- Dashboard/reporting views, users/roles, snapshots, and JSON import/export

## Architecture

Zero-dependency, no-build static web app. UI and logic run client-side; the canonical program lives in Supabase (`programs.state` JSONB). Each signed-in browser also mirrors state to `localStorage` as an offline cache.

```
app.html                    UI shell, sidebar, tab containers, cloud sign-in gate
css/app.css                 all styles (single mobile breakpoint)
js/cloud-config.js          Supabase connection settings
js/cloud-auth.js            Sign-in, program load/sync, account menu
js/nist-control-text.js     verbatim NIST 800-53 control text lookup
js/core.js                  STATE shape, defaults, persistence, audit/change log
js/program.js               CISO setup wizard + demo snapshots
js/policies.js              Domain Policies wizard + policy library
js/controls.js              Control Implementation wizard + control library
js/assets.js                Assets & SSP wizard + asset libraries
js/baseline-elevation.js    Baseline elevation triggers and review flow
js/authorization.js         AO decision data + decision modal
js/reports.js               Reports & Dashboard, audit/change-log, review queues
js/admin.js                 Users & roles, profile / account menu
js/app.js                   App shell: tabs, snapshot modal, beforeunload
```

`js/testing.js` exists as a stub for legacy snapshot/export references but is **not** loaded by `index.html`.

Technical characteristics:

- no framework, no build pipeline
- program state synced to Supabase; mirrored in `localStorage` under `eightfiftythree-grc-v1` for the signed-in browser
- saved snapshots stored in `localStorage` under `eightfiftythree-grc-snapshots`
- existing users with data under the legacy `larsen-grc-*` or `hawthorn-grc-*` keys are automatically migrated on first load

## Local Development

1. Copy or configure `js/cloud-config.js` with your Supabase project URL and anon key (see `MULTI_USER_SETUP.md`).
2. Serve the repository root from any static file server, for example `python -m http.server 8765` or `npx serve .`.
3. Open `app.html` in a modern browser and sign in (or create an account).
4. Complete program setup or continue an existing cloud program.

### Smoke test before shipping

1. `node --check js/<each file>.js` — syntax validation across all modules.
2. Sign in and walk the CISO wizard end to end (Step 1 → Step 5, including the "different approver" path on Step 3).
3. Reset the program and confirm the cloud program returns to a fresh state.
4. Add roster users and confirm each role sees the intended tabs after signing in with that account.
