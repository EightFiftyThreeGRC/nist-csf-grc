# EightFiftyThree GRC — NIST CSF 2.0

Browser-based NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 program management tool. Sign in with your work account; program data syncs through Supabase.

**[Launch the tool](https://eightfiftythreegrc.github.io/nist-csf-grc/)** (repo: [EightFiftyThreeGRC/nist-csf-grc](https://github.com/EightFiftyThreeGRC/nist-csf-grc))

If the link shows “404 / There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here,” open the repo on GitHub → **Settings → Pages** → set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**, then push to `main` (or run the **Deploy GitHub Pages** workflow manually).

## Repository Status

This repository is the canonical source for **EightFiftyThree GRC — NIST CSF 2.0** (separate from the [800-53 edition](https://github.com/EightFiftyThreeGRC/eightfiftythree-grc)).

- Intended for public GitHub upload and GitHub Pages deployment
- Root documentation is intentionally scoped to operator and contributor essentials
- Long-form internal planning prompts are kept out of root docs for cleaner public presentation

## What It Covers

The application guides teams through a full governance workflow:

- CISO setup wizard (baseline, privacy overlay, PM controls, ISP, policy ownership)
- Domain policy ownership and lifecycle tracking
- Control owner assignment and control implementation status
- Asset and process mapping for SSP-style attestations
- Risks & Issues workspace (triage queue, risk register, POA&M-compatible issues when PM-4 is selected)
- Authorizing-Official decision capture (ATO / IATT / Denial) with conditions, expiry, residual-risk narrative, and digital signature
- Dashboard/reporting views, users/roles, snapshots, and JSON import/export

## Architecture

Zero-dependency, no-build static web app. UI and logic run client-side; the canonical program lives in Supabase (`programs.state` JSONB). Each signed-in browser also mirrors state to `localStorage` as an offline cache.

```
index.html                  public landing page (links to app.html)
app.html                    UI shell, sidebar, tab containers, cloud sign-in gate
css/landing.css             landing page styles
css/app.css                 all app styles (single mobile breakpoint)
js/cloud-config.js          Supabase connection settings
js/cloud-auth.js            Sign-in, program load/sync, account menu
js/entra-auth.js            Microsoft Entra ID (OAuth) sign-in support
js/nist-control-text.js     verbatim NIST 800-53 control text lookup
js/core.js                  STATE shape, defaults, persistence, audit/change log
js/program.js               CISO setup wizard + demo snapshots
js/policies.js              Domain Policies wizard + policy library
js/controls.js              Control Implementation wizard + control library
js/assets.js                Assets & SSP wizard + asset libraries
js/baseline-elevation.js    Baseline elevation triggers and review flow
js/authorization.js         AO decision data + decision modal
js/frameworks.js            Framework alignment tab (ISO 27001 / SOC 2 / HIPAA crosswalks)
js/hub.js                   Command Center home tab
js/reports.js               Reports & Dashboard, audit/change-log, review queues
js/admin.js                 Users & roles, profile / account menu
js/app.js                   App shell: tabs, snapshot modal, beforeunload
scripts/check-all.js        syntax check across all JS modules (npm run check:js)
tests/e2e/                  Playwright smoke tests (npm run test:e2e)
```

`js/testing.js` exists as a stub for legacy snapshot/export references but is **not** loaded by `app.html`.

Technical characteristics:

- no framework, no build pipeline
- program state synced to Supabase; mirrored in `localStorage` under `eightfiftythree-csf-v1` for the signed-in browser
- saved snapshots stored in `localStorage` under `eightfiftythree-csf-snapshots`
- existing users with data under the legacy `larsen-grc-*` or `hawthorn-grc-*` keys are automatically migrated on first load

## Design Constraints (What This Deliberately Is Not)

These are intentional trade-offs, not gaps:

- **Client-side trust boundary.** All application logic runs in the browser. There is no bespoke backend to compromise — authentication and per-program data access are enforced by Supabase Row-Level Security keyed to the signed-in `auth.uid()` (see `supabase/schema.sql`). A fully client-side tool trusts the browser and a shared anon key, so treat it as a program-management workspace, not a vault for secrets.
- **Zero dependencies, no build.** No framework, bundler, or npm supply chain. The source that ships is the source that runs — the whole app is auditable in an afternoon and loads instantly.
- **Portable by default.** The top toolbar's **Export JSON** writes your entire program to a file you control; **Import JSON** restores it. Your program can leave this app at any time.
- **Not** a 3PAO, a substitute for an assessor's judgment, a system-of-record you would run without your own backups, or multi-tenant SaaS.

### Self-Hosting (Bring Your Own Supabase)

Nothing ties the app to a hosted instance. To run it entirely on infrastructure you own:

1. Create your own Supabase project and apply `supabase/schema.sql`.
2. Put your project URL and anon key in `js/cloud-config.js` (see `MULTI_USER_SETUP.md`).
3. Serve the repo root as static files, or fork and deploy your own GitHub Pages.

Combined with first-class JSON export, a cautious adopter always has an out: keep local backups, or host the whole stack yourself.

## Roadmap

EightFiftyThree GRC is a single free tool — there is no paid tier, and no feature is held back for one. Candidate directions, if they prove worth building, land in this app:

- **OSCAL export** — emit SSP / component-definition content as NIST OSCAL for interoperability with federal tooling.
- **CMMC / NIST SP 800-171 crosswalk** — extend the framework-alignment tab so defense-industrial-base SMBs get a zero-install on-ramp to 800-171 / CMMC Level 2.

These are candidates, not commitments — prioritized by whether they make the tool a more convincing, useful program-management workspace.

## Local Development

1. Copy or configure `js/cloud-config.js` with your Supabase project URL and anon key (see `MULTI_USER_SETUP.md`).
2. Serve the repository root from any static file server, for example `python -m http.server 8765` or `npx serve .`.
3. Open `app.html` in a modern browser and sign in (or create an account).
4. Complete program setup or continue an existing cloud program.

### Smoke test before shipping

1. `node --check js/<each file>.js` — syntax validation across all modules.
2. Sign in and walk the CISO wizard end to end (Step 1 → Step 5, including the "different approver" path on Step 3).
3. Reset the program and confirm the cloud program returns to a fresh state.
4. Add roster users and confirm each role sees the intended tabs after signing in with that account.
