# Part 1 — Compliance Specification


**Document Status:** Specification (Pre-Development)
**Baseline:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 & SP 800-53A Assessment Methodology
**Target Audience:** GRC Development Team

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines what the **Control Owner Wizard** in EightFiftyThree GRC must capture, display, and report to satisfy NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 compliance requirements. The Control Owner role is responsible for documenting **control implementation status, evidence, and attestation** in preparation for control assessments.

The wizard must balance two goals:
1. **Compliance Accuracy:** Align with NIST SP 800-53A Assessment Methodology
2. **Operator Clarity:** Help non-experts understand what is required and why

---

## Part 1: Implementation Status Taxonomy

### NIST-Aligned Status Definitions

Each control must have exactly one **implementation status** at any given time:

| Status | NIST Meaning | When to Use | Required Fields |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Not Started** | The control design has not yet commenced; no resources allocated. | Initial state; awaiting implementation plan approval. | — |
| **Planned** | Implementation is scheduled with a defined target date; resources identified. | Remediation plan approved; timeline established. | `targetDate` (required) |
| **In Progress** | Implementation underway; partial functionality achieved; assessment expected within defined window. | Control activities initiated; staff assigned; testing in progress. | `description`, `targetDate` |
| **Implemented** | Control is fully operational and producing observable, measurable effects; evidence exists. | Functional acceptance achieved; operational for ≥30 days (per NIST); evidence collected. | `description`, `implementationDate`, `evidenceSummary`, `evidenceUrls` |
| **Not Applicable** | Control is determined by organization to be inapplicable to this system after formal justification. | Exception approved by CISO/Risk Officer; risk accepted in writing. | `naJustification` (required, ≥100 words) |
| **Inherited** | Functionality satisfied by parent system, service provider, or compensating control. | Control delegated; supplier attestation obtained. | `inheritedFrom`, `inheritanceEvidence` |

### Status Transitions (State Machine)

Valid transitions:
- `Not Started` → `Planned`, `Not Applicable`, `Inherited`
- `Planned` → `In Progress`, `Not Applicable`, `Inherited`
- `In Progress` → `Implemented`, `Not Applicable`, `Inherited`
- `Implemented` → (terminal; no reverse transitions without audit trail)
- `Not Applicable` → (terminal; requires exception review to reverse)
- `Inherited` → (terminal; requires re-assessment to revoke)

**Audit Trail:** Every status change must record:
- Previous status
- New status
- Changed by (user email)
- Changed at (ISO 8601 timestamp)
- Reason (brief text field)

## Part 5: Plain English Control Explanations for Non-Experts

### Per-Control Descriptions (Sample Set)

Each control in the wizard should display both the NIST title and a **non-expert explanation**. Example:

#### AC-2: Account Management
**NIST Title:** Account Management
**What It Is (Plain English):**
> "Your organization needs to create user accounts in a controlled way, regularly review who has access, and remove accounts when people leave. This control ensures that only the right people can access systems."

**Why It Matters:**
> "Without proper account management, terminated employees might still have system access, or unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive data. This is one of the most common security gaps."

**What You Need to Show:**
> - How accounts are requested and approved (policy or form)
> - A recent audit showing who has access and why
> - Evidence that accounts are removed when employees leave
> - A list of all active user accounts

---

#### AU-6: Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
**NIST Title:** Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
**What It Is (Plain English):**
> "Someone in your organization needs to regularly look at system logs (audit records) to find suspicious activity. This isn't a one-time activity—it's ongoing."

**Why It Matters:**
> "Logs are only useful if someone reads them. Without regular review, security incidents can hide in plain sight. This control ensures someone is actually watching for problems."

**What You Need to Show:**
> - A person's job description that includes log review responsibilities
> - A sample log analysis report showing what was found
> - Evidence of a regular schedule (e.g., daily SIEM alerting, weekly report)
> - Screenshots of your monitoring tools or dashboards

---

#### CP-2: Contingency Plan
**NIST Title:** Contingency Plan
**What It Is (Plain English):**
> "Your organization needs a documented plan for what to do if something goes wrong—systems fail, disasters strike, or security is breached. This plan should be tested regularly."

**Why It Matters:**
> "When crisis hits, there's no time to figure things out. A written plan ensures everyone knows their role and can recover quickly, minimizing downtime and data loss."

**What You Need to Show:**
> - A written contingency plan (or disaster recovery plan)
> - Evidence that the plan has been tested (e.g., test results from a drill)
> - Recovery time objectives (RTOs) and how they're met
> - Recent backup verification showing data can be restored

---

#### SI-2: Flaw Remediation
**NIST Title:** Flaw Remediation
**What It Is (Plain English):**
> "Software has bugs. Some bugs are security flaws. Your organization needs a process to find these flaws (via patches, scans, or reports) and fix them quickly."

**Why It Matters:**
> "Attackers scan for known vulnerabilities every day. The faster you patch, the smaller your exposure window. This control ensures patches are prioritized and deployed on a schedule."

**What You Need to Show:**
> - Your patch management policy
> - A log of recent patches deployed
> - Evidence of vulnerability scanning (e.g., Nessus reports)
> - SLAs showing how quickly critical vs. non-critical flaws are fixed
> - A list of exceptions (if any) with justifications

---

---

## Part 6: Control Owner Attestation

### NIST-Compliant Attestation Statement

Every control submission must include an **attestation signature** from the Control Owner. The attestation statement should read:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONTROL OWNER ATTESTATION

I, [Name], in my role as [Title], hereby attest that:

1. The implementation description above accurately reflects how
   control [CONTROL-ID: Control Name] is currently implemented
   in the organization's information systems.

2. The evidence artifacts referenced are authentic, current, and
   demonstrate that the control is operating as described.

3. I am aware that this attestation may be used in security
   assessments, audit proceedings, and regulatory submissions.

4. To the best of my knowledge, the above statements are true
   and complete as of [DATE].

5. I understand that making false statements in this attestation
   may result in disciplinary action.

Attested by:  [Signature or Digital Signature]
Name:         [Full Name]
Title:        [Job Title]
Organization: [Company Name]
Date:         [ISO 8601 Date]
Email:        [Email Address]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Attestation Workflow

1. **Draft Phase:** Control Owner documents implementation without attestation.
2. **Ready for Review:** Control Owner marks control as complete (all required fields filled).
3. **Review Phase:** CISO or designated reviewer examines documentation.
4. **Approved for Attestation:** System sends notification to Control Owner.
5. **Attestation Phase:** Control Owner reviews submission one final time, then digitally signs attestation.
6. **Final State:** Attestation is locked; no further edits allowed without explicit audit trail.

### Digital Signature Requirements

- **Method:** Email-based digital signature with timestamp (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
  - OR browser-based e-signature with HMAC-SHA256 commitment
  - OR PKI-based signature (if available)
- **Non-Repudiation:** System must maintain tamper-evident audit trail showing:
  - Who attested
  - When attestation occurred (ISO 8601)
  - Hash of attested document
  - IP address and user agent (optional but recommended)

## Part 8: Control Categorization & Grouping

### Display Groupings (Instead of Just "By Family")

**Option A: By Operational Category** (Recommended for Control Owners)

Group controls by what they *do* rather than NIST family code:

1. **Access & Identity** (AC, IA, PS)
   - User access controls
   - Authentication & credential management
   - Personnel security
   - Easy for IT Ops to understand

2. **Configuration & Hardening** (CM, SC)
   - System baselines
   - Change control
   - Cryptography
   - Relevant to sysadmins & security engineers

3. **Detection & Monitoring** (AU, SI, CA)
   - Logging & audit
   - System monitoring
   - Vulnerability management
   - Relevant to SOC & security analysts

4. **Planning & Risk Management** (PL, RA, PM)

   - Relevant to procurement & third-party risk

8. **Privacy** (PT, PM-18+)
   - PII handling
   - Privacy notice & consent
   - Privacy controls
   - Relevant if Privacy baseline selected

### Tab/Card Design Per Control in Control Owner Wizard

Each control card in the selection UI should show:

```

## Part 9: Risk Rating & Review Status

### Risk Rating Taxonomy

When displaying or tracking controls, assign a risk rating based on:

| Risk Rating | Meaning | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Critical** | Control completely missing; high-impact asset exposed. | Status='Not Started' + Due < 30 days | CISO escalation required |
| **High** | Control severely deficient; significant gaps. | Status='Not Applicable' without full justification, OR Status='Planned' + Due < 30 days | Remediation plan required |
| **Medium** | Control partially implemented; minor gaps. | Status='In Progress' + Due < 7 days, OR weaknesses in evidence | Monitoring; risk accepted |
| **Low** | Control fully implemented; evidence strong. | Status='Implemented' + evidence present | Routine re-assessment |
| **N/A** | Control not applicable; justified. | Status='Not Applicable' + full justification | N/A (no action) |

### Review Status Workflow

```
Draft → Pending Review → Approved → Attested
  ↓                          ↓          ↓
(Control Owner editing)  (CISO review) (Locked)
                              ↓
                          Rejected
                          (return to Draft)
```

## Part 10: Messaging & Help Text Examples

### In-Line Help for Each Field

**Implementation Description field:**
> "Describe how this control operates in your environment. What systems, processes, or tools are involved? Who is responsible? This should be detailed enough that an auditor could verify it. Minimum 100 words for 'Implemented' status."

**Evidence field:**
> "Attach or link files that prove the control is working. Acceptable types include policies, procedures, access logs, screenshots, audit reports, tickets, test results, or interview notes. For each piece of evidence, briefly explain how it supports the control (e.g., 'Access review report shows 847 users reviewed, 23 exceptions')."

**Not Applicable Justification:**
> "If this control doesn't apply to your organization, explain why with full business or technical justification. For example: 'AC-8 (System Use Notification) does not apply because our organization has no interactive users—all systems are automated backend services.' Minimum 100 words required."

**Inherited From:**
> "If another system or service provider handles this control on your behalf, document the source. Include the name of the parent system or vendor, the service level agreement reference, and a link to their attestation (if available)."

**Due Date:**
> "When should the Control Owner have this control implemented or reviewed? This date is used for priority tracking and due-soon warnings."

### Toast / Alert Messages

**On Status Transition:**
- Status changed to `Implemented`: "✅ Control marked as Implemented. Review and attest to complete submission."
- Status changed to `Not Applicable`: "⚠️ Control marked Not Applicable. Justification required (≥100 words) for audit trail."
- Status changed to `Inherited`: "📋 Control marked Inherited. Supply parent system or service provider attestation reference."

**On Evidence Upload:**
- "✅ Evidence added: POL-IM-001. Consider adding test results or audit logs for stronger proof."

**On Attestation:**
- "✅ Attestation successful. Control locked. Any future changes will require re-attestation."
- "⚠️ Attestation revoked by CISO. Updated implementation description. Please re-attest."

**On Due Date Approaching:**
- **30 days before:** "📅 Due date is in 30 days. Time to finalize implementation."
- **7 days before:** "🚨 Due date is in 7 days. Accelerate evidence collection if needed."
- **Overdue:** "❌ OVERDUE: This control was due [date]. Please update status or request extension."

---

## Part 11: Assessment Role Integration (Conceptual)

### How Control Status Feeds Assessment

The **Assessor** (independent reviewer) role should be able to:

1. **View Control Owner's Documentation:**
   - Implementation narrative
   - Evidence artifacts
   - Current status

2. **Access Test Planning Tools:**
   - Link control to test case
   - Schedule test execution
   - Define test procedures

3. **Record Test Results:**
   - Pass / Fail / Partial
   - Findings & observations
   - Test evidence (logs, screenshots)
   - Recommendations

4. **Provide Feedback:**
   - "Evidence is clear and sufficient for Implemented status"
   - "Control description doesn't match operational reality—recommend In Progress"
   - "Missing critical evidence: access revocation logs"

### Data Model Linkage

```
state.controlTestResults[controlId] = {
  testId: 'TST-AC-2-001',
  controlId: 'AC-2',
  testerEmail: 'tester@company.com',
  testDate: '2026-02-10T10:00:00Z',
  testResult: 'Pass',  // 'Pass' | 'Fail' | 'Partial' | 'Not Yet Tested'
  testProcedure: 'Reviewed IAM system, sampled 50 active users, verified access justification',
  findings: 'No exceptions found. Access review process operating as documented.',
  evidence: [
    { type: 'Log', reference: 'IAM_audit_2026-02-10.csv', description: 'User access audit export' },
    { type: 'Screenshot', reference: 'screenshot_ad_groups.png', description: 'AD group membership verification' }
  ],
  recommendations: 'Continue current practices. Consider expanding access review to include contractor accounts.',
  linkedEvidence: ['ev-001', 'ev-002'],  // links back to Control Owner's evidence
  assessmentStatus: 'Assessed',
  assessmentDate: '2026-02-10T14:30:00Z',
};
```

## Part 13: Example Control Owner Workflow

### Scenario: Control Owner (John Doe) Implementing AC-2

**Step 1: Receive Assignment Notification**
- Email: "You have been assigned AC-2 (Account Management) to implement by 2026-03-31"
- John clicks link → logs into Control Owner tab
- Sees AC-2 card with status "Not Started"

**Step 2: Review Guidance**
- Reads plain English explanation: "Your organization controls who has access to systems..."
- Reads implementation guidance: "Provide user access request & approval documentation, recent access review, deprovisioning process..."
- Reviews evidence types: Policy, procedures, screenshots, logs, tickets

**Step 3: Draft Implementation**
- Clicks "Detail View" → opens control form
- Fills in "Implementation Approach": "Preventive: Active Directory lifecycle management with quarterly access reviews"
- Changes status from "Not Started" → "In Progress"
- Sets targetDate: "2026-03-31"

**Step 4: Collect Evidence**
- Uploads POL-IM-001 (Identity Management Policy) → Evidence type: Policy
- Uploads Access_Review_Q1_2026.xlsx → Evidence type: Log
- Takes screenshot of AD groups → Evidence type: Screenshot
- For each, adds description: "Defines lifecycle processes," "Quarterly user access review," "Current AD group memberships"

**Step 5: Write Narrative**
- Drafts implementation narrative:
  > "The organization implements account management controls through Active Directory. User accounts are requested via ticketing system (JIRA), approved by line manager and IT, then provisioned by IT Operations. Access rights are documented in our Identity Management Policy (POL-IM-001). Quarterly access reviews occur in all departments, comparing current AD group membership against current employee roster. Exceptions are escalated to department heads. Upon employee termination, accounts are disabled within 24 hours per our deprovisioning procedure. This control has been in effect since June 2025."

**Step 6: Add Internal Notes**
- Notes: "Gaps: contractor account deprovisioning needs tightening. Action item for Q2."

**Step 7: Submit for Review**
- Clicks "Mark Ready for Review"
- System validates all required fields are complete
- Email sent to CISO: "John Doe submitted AC-2 for review"

**Step 8: CISO Review**
- CISO reviews narrative, evidence, risk rating
- CISO approves with comment: "Strong implementation. Monitor contractor gaps."
- Email sent to John: "AC-2 approved. Ready for attestation."

**Step 9: Attestation**
- John reads attestation statement
- Clicks "Attest" → signs with email-based OTP verification
- System records attestation with timestamp, signature hash, John's email
- Control locked; status → "Attested"
- Assessor review can proceed using the submitted evidence package

**Step 10: Assessor Review**
- Assessor (separate role) reviews John's documentation
- Schedules on-site test: review IAM system, sample 50 user accounts, verify deprovisioning
- Executes test, records findings: "No exceptions found. Control operating as documented."
- Links test result to control
- Assessor status: "Assessed" ✓

## Appendix B: Evidence Quality Checklist

**For EVERY evidence artifact, validate:**

- [ ] **Authenticity:** Document is genuine (signed/dated by organization)
- [ ] **Currency:** Document is recent (≤90 days old unless policy/procedure)
- [ ] **Relevance:** Evidence clearly supports the control claim
- [ ] **Completeness:** Evidence is not redacted or incomplete
- [ ] **Accessibility:** URL/file is accessible to auditors (or properly redacted for confidentiality)
- [ ] **Context:** Control Owner's description explains *how* evidence supports control
- [ ] **Metadata:** Evidence includes source, date, preparer information

**Example Good Evidence:**
> "Access_Review_Q1_2026.xlsx — Quarterly access review report signed by IT Director (2026-02-10). Shows 847 active users reviewed, 23 exceptions (with approvals), deprovisioning of 12 terminated employees. Proves AC-2 control is operating."

**Example Weak Evidence:**
> "ad_groups_screenshot.png — [No description]. [No date]. [No context]."

## Appendix C: Suggested Plain English Control Descriptions (All 20 Families)

### AC — Access Control
> "Access controls limit who can use your systems and what they can do. The organization creates accounts carefully, reviews who has access regularly, and removes access when people leave."

### AT — Awareness & Training
> "Security awareness ensures everyone understands their role in protecting information. The organization provides annual training and tracks completion."

### AU — Audit & Accountability
> "Audit logs record what happens in systems. Someone regularly reads these logs to find suspicious activity and prove that controls are working."

### CA — Assessment, Authorization & Monitoring
> "Assessments check whether controls are working. Authorization documents (ATOs) formally approve systems for operation. Monitoring checks control effectiveness continuously."

### CM — Configuration Management
> "Configuration management establishes a 'secure baseline' for systems. All changes must be approved and tested before deployment."

### CP — Contingency Planning
> "Contingency planning prepares for disasters. The organization has a documented plan to back up data and recover systems quickly."

### IA — Identification & Authentication
> "Identification & authentication verify that users are who they claim to be. The organization requires passwords, multi-factor authentication, or other proof of identity."

### IR — Incident Response
> "Incident response defines how the organization detects, reports, and recovers from security incidents. Personnel are trained and tested regularly."

### MA — Maintenance
> "Maintenance controls ensure that when systems are serviced, security isn't compromised. Maintenance personnel are vetted and tracked."

### MP — Media Protection
> "Media protection controls how data is stored, transported, and destroyed. Hard drives, USB drives, and paper documents are protected or securely destroyed."

### PE — Physical & Environmental Protection
> "Physical security protects facilities housing computer systems. Locked doors, badge access, surveillance, and environmental controls (temperature, humidity) prevent theft and damage."

### PL — Planning
> "Security plans document what controls are in place and why. Plans are kept current and reviewed annually."

### PM — Program Management
> "Program management oversees the entire information security program across the organization. Resources, budget, and leadership accountability are defined."

### PS — Personnel Security
> "Personnel security ensures that employees are vetted before hiring and that access is removed promptly when they leave."

### PT — PII Processing & Transparency
> "PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling ensures the organization respects privacy. Privacy notices, consent, and data minimization are documented."

### RA — Risk Assessment
> "Risk assessments identify threats and vulnerabilities. The organization periodically assesses risk and updates its remediation plans."

### SA — System & Services Acquisition
> "Acquisition controls ensure that security requirements are included in contracts before systems or software are purchased. Vendors are vetted."

### SC — System & Communications Protection
> "System and communications protection controls ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Network boundaries are protected, and systems are isolated."

### SI — System & Information Integrity
> "System integrity controls prevent malicious changes. Patches are applied promptly, malware protection is active, and logs detect unauthorized changes."

### SR — Supply Chain Risk Management
> "Supply chain risk management ensures that vendors and suppliers don't introduce security vulnerabilities. Suppliers are audited and monitored."

# Part 2 — UX Design Specification


## Overview

The Control Owner wizard guides individuals assigned to implement NIST 800-53 controls through a structured 4-step process. Control Owners receive assignments from Policy Owners (who work in the Policy tab) and use this wizard to document implementation approach, link evidence, and attest to completion. This flow should mirror the Policy Owner's workflow pattern while being tailored to control-level operational work.

**User Journey:**
- Policy Owner assigns AC-1, AC-2, etc. (specific controls) to individual Control Owners
- Control Owner opens the Control tab and runs the 4-step wizard
- For each control: read requirement → document implementation → upload evidence → attest
- Submit all documentation to CISO for audit review

## Wizard Architecture

### Step Names & Subtitles

| Step | Name | Subtitle | Icon |
|------|------|----------|------|
| 1 | My Controls Dashboard | Your assigned controls grouped by family and status | 📋 |
| 2 | Implement Controls | Document how each control is implemented in your environment | 📝 |
| 3 | Evidence & Documentation | Link evidence artifacts for auditor review | 📎 |
| 4 | Attestation & Submit | Final review and digital signature of completion | ✓ |

### Wizard Chrome

- **Header Bar:** Displays current step (e.g., "Step 2 of 4: Implement Controls")
- **Progress Indicator:** Visual bar showing % complete (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## Step 1 — My Controls Dashboard

### Purpose
Give the Control Owner an at-a-glance view of all assigned controls, grouped by family/domain. Show implementation status and quick-start actions.

### Layout Description

**Top Section (Header)**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ My Controls Dashboard                                            │
│ {controls.length} controls assigned across {families.length}     │
│ families · {baseline} baseline {+ privacy overlay}               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Status Cards (4-column grid)**
- **Implemented:** Count + "✅" icon, green accent
- **In Progress / Planned:** Count + "🔄" icon, amber accent
- **Not Started:** Count + "⏳" icon, slate accent
- **Not Applicable:** Count + "—" icon, gray accent

Each card shows:
```
IMPLEMENTED
25
of {total} controls
```

**Progress Bar**
- Shows % of controls marked Implemented
- Visual bar (teal fill) with percentage label
- Completion scale below: "Implemented · In Progress/Planned · Not Started"

**Implementation Status Alert (conditional)**
- If > 0 controls due within 30 days: Show amber banner
- Text: "⚠️ {N} control{s} due within 30 days. Head to Step 2 to document these first."

**Filter Bar**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔍 Search by ID or name…  │ [All Families ▼] │ [All Statuses ▼] │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Control Inventory Table**
- **Columns:**
  - Control ID (monospace, e.g., AC-1)
  - Name (full control name)
  - Family (badge with color, e.g., AC)
  - Baselines (pills: Low, Mod, High, Privacy)
  - Owner (Control Owner name, or "Unassigned" in gray italics)
  - Due Date (e.g., "Jun 15, 26" or "—", bold + warning icon if due within 30 days)
  - Status (colored chip: Not Started / Planned / In Progress / Implemented / Not Applicable)

- **Sorting:** Sortable by Due Date (ascending), Status (by severity)
- **Interaction:** Click any row → open Step 2 with that control selected in detail panel
- **Keyboard:** Tab through rows; Enter to select; arrow keys to navigate

### Key UI Components

**Status Pill Styles**
```
Implemented:      background: #dcfce7, color: #166534, border: #86efac
In Progress:      background: #fef3c7, color: #92400e, border: #fcd34d
Planned:          background: #dbeafe, color: #1d4ed8, border: #93c5fd
Not Applicable:   background: #f1f5f9, color: #64748b, border: #cbd5e1
Not Started:      background: #eff6ff, color: #1e3a5f, border: #bfdbfe (default)
```

**Family Badges**
- Background: Semi-transparent teal (AC, AP, AT, AU, CA, CM, IA, SA, SC, etc.)
- Text: Navy or contrasting dark color
- Border: Light teal outline
- Size: 14px font, 6px padding vertical, 8px horizontal

### Data Read

- `state.baseline` — determines which controls appear
- `state.privacyOverlay` — adds P controls if true
- `state.controlStatus` — status for each control ID
- `state.controlOwners` — owner assignment details (name, email, dueDate)
- `getActiveControls()` — all controls in baseline + privacy overlay
- `getActiveFamilies()` — unique family codes

### Data Written

- `state._selectedCtrl` — which control detail to show in Step 2

### Empty State

If no baseline selected:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        🏛️                               │

│ The CISO must complete program setup to select baseline │
│ and assign controls. Once complete, you can document    │
│ control implementation here.                            │
│                                                         │
│              [ Go to CISO Setup → ]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Validation Rules

- **Step 1 → Step 2:** No validation required. User can advance even if 0 controls documented.
- **Recommended check (warning only):** If user has 0 controls assigned, show: "ℹ️ No controls assigned to you yet. Check with your Policy Owner."

### Footer Buttons

| Button | Label | State | Action |

### Validation Rules

**Step 3 → Step 4 Advancement:**
- No blocking validation
- **Warning if:**
  - Any control marked "Implemented" has 0 evidence items
  - Any control has 0 narrative text
  - More than 20% of controls have missing evidence
- **Toast message:** "⚠️ {N} controls are missing evidence/narratives. You can still proceed; they'll be flagged in submission."

```

After close:
- Redirect to Step 1 (My Controls Dashboard)
- Show toast: "✅ Submitted to CISO — 23 of 30 controls (77%) implemented."
- Update table to show submission status (optional: show "Submitted" date column)

### Data Read

- `state.controlStatus` — all controls with implementation status
- `getActiveControls()` — for summary counts
- `state.baseline`, baseline counts
- Current user name / email (from session or form input)
- Current date

### Data Written

- `state.controlSubmissionDate` — new Date().toLocaleDateString()
- `state.controlAttestationDate` — new Date().toLocaleDateString()
- `state.attestedBy` — current user name
- Optionally flag `state.controlStatus.submitted = true` per control

### Empty State

(Should not occur — user gets here from Step 3 which has content)

### Validation Rules

**Attestation Checkbox Required**
- If unchecked: Submit button disabled, show hint "☐ Check the box above to enable submission"
- If checked: Submit button enabled

**Before Advancing from Step 3 to Step 4:**
- No hard blocks, but **strongly recommend:**
  - All controls have status != "Not Started" (warning toast)
  - All "Implemented" controls have ≥1 evidence item (warning toast)

**On Submit Click:**
- Validate checkbox is checked
- If not: shake button, show inline error "Please confirm the attestation statement"
- If valid: Show success modal, save submission metadata, redirect to Step 1

## State Object: New Fields Required

Add to `const state = { }` in app code:

```javascript
// ─── Control Owner Implementation Data ───
controlStatus: {},              // { 'AC-1': { status, approach, narrative, evidence[], notes, submitted? } }
controlOwners: {},              // { 'AC-1': { name, role, email, dueDate } }
// (Already exists from Policy Owner assignment flow)

// ─── Control Owner Wizard Navigation ───
_controlWizardMode: false,      // true = wizard open, false = list view
_selectedCtrl: null,            // currently selected control ID in Step 2
_controlOwnerFilter: '',        // optional: filter by assigned owner name

// ─── Control Owner Submission State ───
controlSubmissionDate: '',      // when controls were submitted (YYYY-MM-DD)
controlAttestationDate: '',     // when attestation was signed (YYYY-MM-DD)
attestedBy: '',                 // name/email of person who attested
controlSubmissionStatus: {},    // { 'AC-1': 'Submitted' | 'In Review' | 'Returned' }
```

## Helper Functions to Implement

```javascript
// Navigation
function enterControlWizard()
  // Set _controlWizardMode = true, show Step 1, render wizard chrome

function exitControlWizard()
  // Set _controlWizardMode = false, return to Control tab landing

function goToControlStep(stepNumber)
  // Set currentStep.control = stepNumber, re-render entire Step

// Step 2: Implementation
function selectControlDetail(ctrlId)
  // Set state._selectedCtrl = ctrlId, re-render form on right

function setCtrlStatus(ctrlId, status)
  // state.controlStatus[ctrlId].status = status

function setCtrlField(ctrlId, field, value)
  // state.controlStatus[ctrlId][field] = value

function addCtrlEvidence(ctrlId)
  // Push new empty evidence object to state.controlStatus[ctrlId].evidence[]

function removeCtrlEvidence(ctrlId, index)
  // Remove evidence item at index

function setEvidenceField(ctrlId, idx, field, value)
  // state.controlStatus[ctrlId].evidence[idx][field] = value

// Step 3: Evidence refinement
function getControlsWithoutEvidence()
  // Filter controls where evidence.length === 0 and status !== 'Not Applicable'

function getControlsWithoutNarrative()
  // Filter controls where narrative.trim().length === 0

// Step 4: Submission
function submitControlImplementation()
  // Validate attestation checkbox, save submission date, show success modal

function downloadControlReport()
  // Generate PDF or CSV of all controls + status + evidence refs
```

## Domain Grouping Logic

**Scenario:** A Control Owner (e.g., "IAM Director") is assigned controls from multiple families (AC + IA merged under CISO Step 4's merge feature).

**Handling in Step 1 Dashboard:**

Option A: **Group by Family** (Recommended)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AC — Access Control (8 controls)                    │
│ ✓ Start Implementing AC Controls                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ IA — Identification & Authentication (6 controls)  │
│ ✓ Start Implementing IA Controls                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Show family-level cards with control counts and quick-start buttons
- Each family group shows:
  - Family code + full name
  - Count of controls in family
  - Count by status (X Implemented, Y In Progress, Z Not Started)
  - Collapsible table of controls within family
  - "Start Implementing {Family}" button → opens Step 2 filtered to that family

Option B: **All Controls in One List** (Simpler)
- Single table with all controls from all families
- Family column shows which domain each belongs to
- Filter dropdown lets user isolate to one family

**Recommended:** Option A (family cards) — mirrors Policy Owner's natural workflow of thinking in families, makes dashboard easier to scan for users with 20+ controls across multiple families.

**In Step 2 List:** Show only controls assigned to this Control Owner. If multiple families, show family badge on each item.

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Accessibility

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Tab | Next field / row | All |
| Shift+Tab | Previous field / row | All |
| Arrow Up / Down | Navigate control list | Step 2 list |
| Enter | Select control | Step 2 list |
| Ctrl+S / Cmd+S | Save Draft | All |
| Escape | Close modals | Evidence add modal |

**ARIA Labels:**
- All form inputs have `aria-label` or explicit labels
- Status dropdowns announce selected value
- Evidence list announces: "Evidence item 1 of 3"
- Progress bars have `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`
- Attestation checkbox has role="checkbox" and aria-checked state

## Comparison to Policy Owner Wizard

| Aspect | Policy Owner | Control Owner |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Step 1** | Review & Custodian (metadata) | My Controls Dashboard (status overview) |
| **Step 2** | Control Selection (which controls) | Implement Controls (how to implement) |
| **Step 3** | Document Policy (write policy doc) | Evidence & Documentation (attach proof) |
| **Step 4** | Assign Control Owners (to individuals) | Attestation & Submit (final sign-off) |
| **Duration** | 30-45 min | 60-90 min (1 control per 5-10 min) |
| **Frequency** | Once per domain per year | Rolling (as controls are assigned) |
| **Output** | Domain policy document | Control implementation proof (evidence) |

## Empty States Summary

| Step | Trigger | Message | CTA |
|------|---------|---------|-----|
| 1 | No baseline selected | "CISO Setup Required" | Go to CISO Setup |
| 1 | Baseline selected, 0 controls assigned | "No Controls Assigned" | "Check with your Policy Owner" |
| 2 | Control list open, no control selected | "Select a control from the list" | Click list item |
| 3 | All controls have evidence + narratives | "✅ Complete — ready to submit" | Proceed to Step 4 |
| 4 | (Should not occur) | N/A | N/A |

## Implementation Notes for Developer

1. **Reuse existing CSS classes:** .form-label, .form-input, .form-select, .btn, .chip, .family-badge, .control-id, .table-scroll, .empty-state
2. **Color palette:** Consistent with Policy/CISO tabs (--teal, --navy, --red, --green, --amber, --gray)
3. **Progress tracking:** Show % on header and in Step 1 dashboard (match CISO Step 4 and Policy Step 4 patterns)
4. **Save Draft:** Throttle to once per 30 seconds to avoid excessive localStorage writes
5. **Responsive:** Wizard should work on 1366px+ width; collapse left panels on smaller screens
6. **Undo/Recovery:** localStorage auto-save allows recovery if page accidentally closed during wizard (show "Resume wizard?" prompt on tab open)
